# COSC140 homework 2

## Homework feedback

 * How long did you spend on this homework?
  I spent a lot of time on the first part (due to figuring out the math) but much less on the second part. I really liked working with turtle and I think I made a decent picture of a beach. I'm still getting used to comp sci problems.
 * What did you think about it?  What was good?  What could be improved?
I think it was good. I had to think outside of the box for the first part and it was pretty reasonable. I think the turtle homework should have been assigned after learning loops and not before, I was struggling working with them for a bit. I tried to find a unique way of making waves by implementing a sine wave function drawing which was fun to code. Definitely the hardest part for me is knowing where to start with coding. It's like learning a new language and grammar at the same time.
